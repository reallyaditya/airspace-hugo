## Grande Comore & Mayotte

The Comoro Islands or Comoros (Shikomori Komori; Arabic: جزر القمر‎, Juzur al-Qomor; French: Les Comores) form an archipelago of volcanic islands situated off the southeastern coast of Africa, to the east of Mozambique and northwest of Madagascar. The islands are politically divided between the Union of the Comoros (pop. 850,688) and two territories of France: the department of Mayotte (pop. 270,372) and the uninhabited Glorioso Islands, a part of the Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean, the 5th district of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands.

The Comoro Islands are located in the Mozambique Channel to the north-west of Madagascar and facing Mozambique. These volcanic islands, covering a total area of 2034 km2, are as follows:

Ngazidja (also known as Grande Comore): the largest island of the Union of the Comoros, with its capital Moroni
Ndzuwani (also known as Anjouan): part of the Union of the Comoros
Mwali (also known as Mohéli): part of the Union of the Comoros
Mayotte (also known as Maore): a French overseas department. with its capital Mamoudzou. Mayotte is composed of two islands, Grande-Terre and Petite-Terre (also known as Pamanzi). where the Dzaoudzi–Pamandzi International Airport is located.
The Glorioso Islands, comprising Grande Glorieuse, Île du Lys and eight little rock islets, were administratively attached to the archipelago before 1975, and, geologically speaking, form a part of the archipelago.

Notable reefs that are part of the archipelago are as follows:

Banc Vailheu, or Raya, a submerged volcano located 20 km west of Grand Comoro
Banc du Geyser, a reef measuring 8 by 5 km in area, situated 130 km North-East of Grande-Terre
Banc du Leven, a former island between Madagascar and Grande-Terre which is now submerged
